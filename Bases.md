- Let U be a [subspace]([[Subspaces]]) in $R^n$, a finite set of the subspace will be a base
- n vectors can at most span $R^n$
- All vectors in the base are independent and the base [[Span]] the space
- A [subspace]([[Subspaces]]) will always have infinitely many subspaces, unless U is 0
- A standard base will contain the elementary vectors where the n'th vector contains a 1 at the n'th position. Analogous to the [[Identity Matrix]]
- Given a [[Linear combination]] of [[Vectors]] , any given point in the [[Coordinates]] system can be represented by the coordinates in relation to the base, aka number of steps used of each [[Basis vector]]. If we have vector the basis vectors $b_1$ and $b_2$ and $e$, to find e we solve the matrix $[b_1, b_2 | e]$
- $\mathcal{B}$ is a base for $\mathcal{U}$ if span of the [[Basis vector]]s are equal to the [subspace]([[Subspaces]])
- [[Change of basis]]
- The [[Dimensionality]] of a basis is the number of vectors in said base
