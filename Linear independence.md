- #[[Linear dependence]]
- A set of vectors is linearly independent if a linear combination of the vectors only has one solution, 0.
- If all scalars of the [linear combination]([[Linear combination]]) are 0, then it is [linearly dependent]([[Linear dependence]])
- If [[Rank]] of the array of the [[System of linear equations]] is equal to the number of equations, then it   is independent
- A square matrix is [invertible]([[Inverse]]) iff the columns or rows are linearly independent.
