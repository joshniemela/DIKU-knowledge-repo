- [[Row Echelon]] is a more general case of RRE where the following has to hold
	- All rows consisting of zeroes are at the bottom
	- Every column containing a leading entry has only zeroes below it
- [[Reduced Row Echelon]] can be computed using [[Gauss-Jordan elimination]] on a [[System of linear equations]]
	- In contrast to Row Echelon, this also requires every leading entry to be equal to 1
	- All values above a leading entry must also be 0
