- A matrix is a $m \times n$ ($m$ by $n$) rectangular array with $mn$ entries, where
	- $m =$ **number of rows**
	- $n =$ **number of columns**.
- Matrices are commonly denoted by boldfaced capital letters: **A, B, C, D,** etc.
- An $m \times 1$ matrix is called a **column vector** or **m-vector** (see, [[Vectors]]).
- Matrices can also represent [[Graphs]] in the form of an [[Adjacency Matrix]]
