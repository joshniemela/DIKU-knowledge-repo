- Trivial FDs:
	- $A \to B$ is trivial $\iff B \subseteq A$
	- $A \to A$ is trivial
- Non-trivial FDs:
	- $A \to B$ is non-trivial $\iff B \nsubseteq A$
	- if $A \cap B = \emptyset$ then it is a complete non-trivial FD.
- Armstrong Axioms:
	- Axiom of reflexivity:
		- trivial FDs
	- Axiom of augmentation:
		- if $A \to B$ holds, then $AX \to BX$ also holds $\forall X$
	- Axiom of transitivity:
		- if $A \to B$ and $B \to C$ holds, then $A \to C$ also holds.
- Derived Armstrong rules:
	- Union:
		- If $A \to B$ and $A \to C$ holds, then $A \to BC$ holds
	- Composition:
		- If $A \to B$ and $X \to Y$ holds, then $AX \to BY$ also holds.
	- Decomposition:
		- if $A \to BC$ holds then $A \to B$ and $A \to C$ also holds
	- Pseudo-transitivity:
		- If $A \to B$ and $BC \to D$ holds, then $AC \to D$ holds
