	- Cross-product
	- Set-difference
	- Union
- Additional
	- Intersection
	- Join
	- Antijoin
	- Division

- Relational algebra is closed and operators can be composed.
- Expressibility complications:
	- Find highest salary of an employee
		- Create a dominance relation and divide by original table, this finds the most [dominating]([[Dominating set]]) employee in the set
	- No recursion
- A bag is a multiset, [[SQL]] uses bag semantics
- [[Extended Relational Algebra]]
- If a tuple is dangling under a join:
	- Natural join destroys this tuple
	- Outer join pads with $\bot$
- Outer join has three variants, subscript L only preserves left, subscript R preserves right, no subscript preserves both.
- In contrast to [[Relational Calculus]], this language is constructed
