- Let U be a [subspace](#subspaces) in $R^n$, a finite set of the subspace will be a base
- n vectors can at most span $R^n$
- All vectors in the base are independent and the base [Span](#span) the space
- A [subspace](#subspaces) will always have infinitely many subspaces, unless U is 0
- A standard base will contain the elementary vectors where the n'th vector contains a 1 at the n'th position. Analogous to the [Identity Matrix](#identitymatrix)
- Given a [Linear combination](#linearcombination) of [Vectors](#vectors) , any given point in the [Coordinates](#coordinates) system can be represented by the coordinates in relation to the base, aka number of steps used of each [Basis vector](#basisvector). If we have vector the basis vectors $b_1$ and $b_2$ and $e$, to find e we solve the matrix $[b_1, b_2 | e]$
- $\mathcal{B}$ is a base for $\mathcal{U}$ if span of the [Basis vector](#basisvector)s are equal to the [subspace](#subspaces)
- [Change of basis](#changeofbasis)
- The [Dimensionality](#dimensionality) of a basis is the number of vectors in said base
