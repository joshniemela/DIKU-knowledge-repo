- An [[Elementary Row Operators]] applied on a matrix has the following effect on the determinant:
  ero(A) => B
  Addition has no effect on determinant $det B = det A$
  Swapping results in the sign flipping $det B = -det A$
  Scalar multiplication results in a scalar multiplication of the determinant $det B = a det A$
