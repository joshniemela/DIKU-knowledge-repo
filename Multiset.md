- The union of two multisets just results in all of the elements
- The intersection is the minimum of each element occurring in both sets
- The set difference subtracts the number of occurances in sets, if less than 0 then truncate to 0
- The commutative property holds
- Set union is not idempotent for multisets, $\{1, 2\} \cup \{1, 2\} = \{1, 1, 2, 2\}$
