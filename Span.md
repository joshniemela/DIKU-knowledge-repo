- Let $\mathcal{S}$ be a set of [[Vectors]] in $\mathbb{R}^n$:
  Set span $\mathcal{S} = span \{v_1... v_k\} := \{ x_1 v_1 + ... x_k v_k, x_k \in \mathbb{R}\}$
- Span is the set of all linear combinations of all vectors in the space.
- Span $\emptyset = \{ 0\}$
- You set up the span as a [[System of linear equations]] to figure out if the vector is in the span. If it has at least one solution, then the vector is in the span.
- $\mathcal{S}$ spans $\mathcal{U}$ if span S = U
