- #Vectors
- Vector multiplication has vector addition (and the inverse), as well as scalar multiplication, analogous to [[Elementary Row Operators]]
	- Vector space ($V$) is represented as $\mathbb{R}^n$ and has to hold the following properties from Def 7.1:
		- Addition: $V \times V \to V$
		- Scalar multiplication $R \times V \to V$
- [[Matrices]] are a vector space since matrices are a generalised [vector]([[Vectors]]).
- [Polynomial]([[Polynomials]]) space is an abstract vector space
- Functions are also within a abstract vector space if they are defined across a set
- Theorem 3.1 contains various operations and identities for vector space
