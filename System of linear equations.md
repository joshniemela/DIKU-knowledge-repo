- Is said to be in row echelon if its [[Augmented matrices]] is in [[Row Echelon]]
- A SoLE is said to be inconsistent if the [canonical form]([[Reduced Row Echelon]]) contains one or more equations that can be reduced to 0=1
	- This also means it has zero solutions, and is equivalent to proving by contradiction that there are no solutions.
- A SoLE has infinite solutions if there are any free or [independent]([[Linear independence]]) variables
- A SoLE has one solution if there are no free variables and the system is consistent
